        <p>I expect everyone to have read my Terms of Service before contacting me about a commission. If you have questions about payments, the commissioning process, what I can do, or what you can do, you will find explanations here. Any questions not answered can be sent my way and I will try my best!</p>

        <p>1.0 - PAYMENT</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1.1</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;I primarily accept payments through PayPal and Etsy. There is no guarantee I can make other payment methods work but I will try if needed.</li>
            <li><strong>1.2</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;I reserve the right to refuse or cancel a commission at any time for any reason.</li>
            <li><strong>1.3</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not send a payment before it is requested.</li>
            <li><strong>1.4</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;You will be asked to pay in full before I start.</li>
            <li><strong>1.5</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Prices may vary. The ones listed are used as an average/base. Send me a message with your prompt if you would like an exact quote.</li>
            <li><strong>1.6</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Refunds may be given on cancelled commissions depending on current progress. A simple guideline for how refund amounts are calculated are as follows: Full refunds are given to any stages that were paid for but not started. Stages that were started but not completed will be refunded a percentage of that stage based of level of completion. Refund amounts may vary.​</li>
        </ul>

        <p>2.0 - PROCESS</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>2.1</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The drawing and check-in process will occur in stages: rough, cleaning, and shading. If a piece has a background, the background may manifest at any stage or require an additional stage after shading. Not all commissions require all stages.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>2.1a</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The rough stage is defined as a messy rendering of your character(s) regardless of coloring or lack thereof.</li>
                <li><strong>2.1b</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The cleaning stage is defined as a clean-lined and clean-colored render of your character(s).</li>
                <li><strong>2.1c</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The shading stage is defined as a colored and shaded rendering of your character(s) regardless of whether it is rough or clean.</li>
                <li><strong>2.1d</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The background stage is defined as a render of your character within a defined or abstracted scene, regardless of the character's level of finish.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>2.2</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;After each stage, I will send a work-in-progress (WIP) image to check in and make sure the piece is turning out how you want. I will make a maximum of 5 small changes after each stage. If the commissioner has approved a stage or if 5 small changes have been made to that stage, that aspect of the drawing will not be revised in future stages.</li>
            <li><strong>2.3</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;You may ask for updates and progress screenshots at any time, even outside of the automatic check-ins I will perform after each stage.</li>
            <li><strong>2.4</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Redlining (the act of drawing over an image for correction/demonstration purposes) my WIP images is encouraged if you feel like it will help! Providing any outside supplemental images is also encouraged to give me the best idea of what you are looking for.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>3.0 - WHAT I CAN AND CAN NOT DO</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>3.1</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;I will attempt most species. For bipedal non-human characters, I will draw the character's legs consistent with the reference unless otherwise requested (such as digitigrade, plantigrade, etc.) or I'll choose if neither are supplied. </li>
            <li><strong>3.2</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not copy other people's or company's art styles outside of eye style or other specific circumstances. </li>
            <li><strong>3.3</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;I reserve the right to display my work anywhere and in any way at any stage of the process unless otherwise discussed. </li>
            <li><strong>3.4</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am an adult and I will take on not-safe-for-work (NSFW) or 18+ commissions from other adults only. There will be an upcharge based on the severity of the content. A specific guideline for this is currently in the works!</li>
            <li><strong>3.5</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;You may ask if I can do anything that is not covered in this TOS.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>4.0 - WHAT YOU CAN AND CAN NOT DO</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>4.1</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;You may edit work of mine that you own in any manner you see fit so long as the watermark or signature remains intact and completely visible.</li>
            <li><strong>4.2</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you did not buy it or if it does not otherwise belong to you, do not edit it! ("It" being my work.)</li>
            <li><strong>4.3</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not claim it to be your own work outside of any edits you make.</li>
            <li><strong>4.4</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;You may not use any of my work commercially unless terms have already been discussed and agreed upon.</li>
            <li><strong>4.5</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;You may re-post my work anywhere as long as proper credit is given. Linking back to the original post and/or artist somewhere in the description or on the image itself is encouraged but not necessary.</li>
